  This shiny application project takes GADM data as available online for all countries.
  Here the country INDIA has been selected. There was very little manual work done to
  arrange data such as STATE and District List, other than that, all data has been
  used "as available" from the web sites as mentioned in reference below.
  We start with displaying the country map and then application allows users to select
  either whole country and view various data associated with it such as population,
  forest area, economic(gdp) etc.. Application also allows to select a particular
  state and view its summary indicators as well as the maps with district boundaries.
  
  All plots and summaries are dynamically generated through Shiny and R language features.
  UI section also gets drop-down from the data dynamically.
